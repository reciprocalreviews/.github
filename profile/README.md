## Welcome!

We are Reciprocal Reviews, a volunteer community of researchers and academics interested more sustainable, reciprocal, equitable academic peer review. We're just building out this platform and community, so for now, check out the [reciprocal reviews proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RHirbCdQFxBeCbjAAbba1MJtxDOG4cuml66_xWGgXAI/edit#heading=h.gtlebyp3cvjf) that Amy Ko wrote for the ACM Transactions on Computing Education journal. It describes the vision and rationale for the project. Eventually, we'll migrate those details here.

Currently, there are five contributors to this effort:

* [Amy Ko](mailto:ajko@uw.edu) (University of Washington), project management, design, and front end
* [Jérémie Lumbroso](mailto:lumbroso@cis.upenn.edu) (University of Pennsylvania), design, back end and ops
* [Andrew Petersen](mailto:andrew.petersen@utoronto.ca) (University of Toronto), policy

Would you like to chat with us, other contributors, or other folks interested in sustainable peer review? [Write Amy](mailto:ajko@uw.edu?subject=Slack%20invite?) an email and we'll send you an invite to [our Slack](https://reciprocalreviews.slack.com).

Write Amy to learn more.
